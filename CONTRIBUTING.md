Thank you so much for checking out how to add new items to our lists. The more people that collaborate on this, the better this project will be!


So if you want to add anything, of if you have suggestions, or if you are just curious about how. You should keep on reading this little guide.


The best way to add something is through the gitlab project issue page.


When you have arrived there, you have to click on the "new issue" button.


You should now be presented with the new issue page, and to make everyone's life easier, we have added issue templates for the most common entries.


All you have to do is add a descriptive title to the issue, fill out the issue template (or not, depending on what you are doing of course). And hit the submit issue button.


The next step is now in the hands of the project's curator. He or she will check out if you filled out everything correctly and accepts the issue or not.


Again. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. And if you think this contribution guide could be better written. Please follow the guidelines above and submit an issue about it.
